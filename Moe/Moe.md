Maurelya ("Moe"), by day, is a line cook at a roadside diner called [[The Last Line (Narrative)|The Last Line]], working for her friend [[Sal]]. Her true job is a detective that investigates cases dealing with the strange, the magical, and the occult.

Moe was once an [[Osenist]], an enclave of secret magicians that claimed to be devoted to the extreme preservation of magical knowledge. They believed that magic, if not perfectly executed, was not worthy of being executed at all. She worked as a [[Prospectus Archivist]], where she helped managed the books, instruments, and resources of the Osenists.

Moe was the sole interloper of [[Mandragora (Narrative)|failed Mandragora ritual]]. The ritual would not be entirely successful regardless of her intervention, but she was able to subdue and destroy the imperfect creature before it could cause untold destruction. Knowing this would brand her a traitor of the Osenists, she fled. 

Now deeply aware of the harm she has been complicit to, she has devoted herself to a life of helping others.

*Personality*
Moe is a stoic but considerate individual. She does her best to maintain a calm demeanor, even in the face of grave danger and true horror. Even though she maintains a logical approach to the cases she takes, she also makes it a point to understand how things came to pass, including the trauma that others are expressing. This has led her to [[There is always another way|always prefer the restorative path]], where healing takes precedence over retribution. Nonetheless, she is also aware that sometimes, that just will not do the trick. In other words, she'll try the hug first, but the gun is there in case that doesn't work.

To others, Moe can be seen as cold, calculating, and uncooperative. She has her means of making sure things remain under control, and she sees pleasing everybody as a foregone prospect. She trusts her own abilities and knowledge enough to know what actions need to be taken, even if she upsets other people along the way. She initially distrusts people who act as authorities, but she can reach consensus with them if they prove themselves.

As a former Prospectus Archivist, she is a meticulous notetaker. She is known to quickly fill journals, and also to have many blank journals at the ready. She is also known to keep arg.tifacts from her case that were at some point relevant - or, at least, detrimental to others if fallen into the wrong hands. She deems herself the guardian of these things.

Moe is a salt-of-the-earth kind of person. Having come from a complex world of magic and knowledge, she has chosen the peacefulness of a simple life. She lives in her truck, which she affectionately calls "[[Bessie]]", and cares for herself at a nearby truck stop. She enjoys a good cup of coffee, watching the sunrise, and the companionship of animals. Moe is a heavy smoker, and her cigarette case has etchings of the protective runes that have failed to do their jobs (which, inevitably, led to her getting involved in the case).
