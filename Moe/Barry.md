Barry is Moe's contact for cases. Barry and Moe communicate almost exclusively on the phone. Barry is the only person with Moe's number, and Moe only uses the phone to talk to Barry.

Barry's larger connections to the world are unknown to Moe, and she prefers to keep it that way. She also keeps information about herself limited to Barry, and all that he really knows is that she prefers to meet her clients at [[The Last Line]]. Barry doesn't seem to mind the cloak and daggers - it would appear that he's just happy to be part of making the world a better place by sending information to Moe.

*Gameplay*
Players will rarely interact with Barry directly. There will be options for Moe to contact Barry about the state of the case and get some information about the mundane world, but these will be under very specific conditions (i.e. quest circumstances).

Barry will most often be an instigating factor for the main cases of the game. He is the one who directs Cassie to Moe, which in turn leads to [[Ridgewreath Farm]]. He will also play a major role in finding [[The Town]] and in the pursuit of [[Priest(Narrative)|Priest]].

During the starting menu, loading screens, etc., there will be a chance to see Moe on a phone call with Barry, where she will be wrapping up a conversation with him before putting her phone away so the player can take control of her. Idle dialogue can also include Moe saying things like, "Barry, what have you gotten me into this time?"

***Q&A***
*Is "Barry" a code name?*
Probably. 

*How did Barry and Moe meet?*
Uncertain. We may not need to explain that. People's paths cross all the time.

*Who does Barry work for?*
Himself, I guess. What's more important is that we figure out who he *doesn't* work for. See below.

*Is Barry an [[Osenist]]?*
No. Expand the world.

*Is Barry Priest?/Does Barry work for Priest?*
No. Priest could probably use the illusion of Barry to try to trick Moe, but the idea that he is Barry is not something I'm a fan of.

*Is Barry some kind of deity that has taken a liking to Moe?*
Unlikely. I haven't given this specific possibility much thought, but I really don't like the idea of divine intervention helping Moe help people. The theming should really highlight that Moe, despite her abilities and knowledge, is just a regular person doing her best to fight the powers that be on behalf of the little guys that suffer under their thumb. Her greatest power is her iron will, NOT that she has been blessed in some way. A divine power acting in a way that gives Moe an upper hand really undercuts that narrative. She would also probably be able to confirm if Barry was such a thing, and she wouldn't ally with him out of principle. 

*Is Barry a figment of Moe's imagination?*
No, he's real. We can confirm this by having other characters mention him, i.e. Cassie will say something like, "Barry told me you can help me."

*Will Barry's physical form appear in the game(s)?*
That is not part of the plan right now. I much prefer that he is implied, rather than an explicit character of his own. At most, I would probably accept hearing his voice through the speaker on Moe's phone.

*How do people find Barry?*
We don't need to worry about that now. We can make some offhanded dialogue about it later on in the story, but I don't think it's super important to the narrative.

*Why so cagey with the details?*
We don't need to explain *everything.* Barry can remain unexplainable while still providing the illusion of a larger world beyond what we see in the games.
