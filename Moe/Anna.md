Sorcerer plagued with grief

Anna is a character in the series. She is the primary antagonist of [[The Farm (Project)||The Farm]] and may remain a supporting character throughout the series, depending on logistics.

Anna is a very powerful spellcaster with a natural ability to tap into her considerable well of magical energy. Throughout her whole life, she used her magical abilities without realizing it, consequently creating an intense concentration of energy at [[Ridgewreath Farm]] that is the source of the strange occurrences that happen there.

At some point in her life, she and her husband [[Scoth]] had a [[Anna's Baby||child]]. The child died at a young age, which plummeted Anna into a deep depression. This caused the magical energy she had accidentally woven through the area to become unstable. This led further miseries for Anna - her plants and animals began to die, massive floods from nowhere, that sort of thing.

One day, [[Priest(Narrative)|a man claiming to be a traveling priest]] came to see Anna after he, in his words, "felt [her] sadness for miles." He came in to hear the couples woes. He used this to show that Anna was an extremely capable, if undisciplined, magician, and gave her some guidance and tools to use her powers.

Specifically, he was able to convince her that she capable of harnessing souls from the world around her, implying that she would be able to reclaim her son in due time. He suggested to Anna that she would be able to bring her son back by finding him an appropriate host body, as his current physical state was far too decayed to be effective. 

In truth, this sort of magic is just not possible for most people to understand (and, thus, use). Even if Anna *could* do it, Priest had deceived her. He instead set her on a path to consistently make a well of dark, miserable energy from which he could personally draw power, with Anna acting as a conduit for his own purposes.

Anna and Scoth would work together to "save" their child by luring people to the farm under various guises (a bed and breakfast, historical marker, tourist location, real estate, whatever), and then attempting a "soul transfer" on the unsuspecting guests. The tragedy is that Anna did not know enough to know what she was doing - she not only *wasn't* bringing her son back, but she was also condemning innocent people to an eternity of wandering the magical prison of her farmstead while their bodies rotted, changed, and mutated. 

Convinced by Priest that she could save them all (including her son), she maintained this practice for many years until the power she had seeped out beyond the farm itself, creating invisible threads that compel people and animals toward the farm. These threads are the instigating factors of [[Cassie]] seeking out [[Moe]], which in turn led her to Ridgewreath Farm. This also attracted the attention of the [[Osenists]], who will begin investigating the Farm near the end of the game. However, Anna will kill the operating agents, ending their initial investigation and muddying their understanding of the events of the first game.

*Gameplay*
As Moe/the player progress the story, visages of Anna, Scoth, and their history on Ridgewreath Farm will be seen when Moe uses [[Psychometry|psychometry]]. At first, these visions are passive.

However, as Moe makes further progress on the case, Anna will become aware of her interference and begin interacting with her. She will mention that the priest warned her about Moe and will be actively aggressive toward her around the midway mark of the game.

Anna will be a major encounter at least twice in the game. In her first encounter with Moe, she will display considerable magical power that is impressive and frightening in how undisciplined it is. Moe's task will be to escape Anna's assault so she can find a way to control the woman's powers.

The second encounter with Anna - and the final encounter of the game - sees Anna engaged with Moe and [[Midnight]] in a duel that spans a sizeable portion of Ridgewreath Farm. It will begin at the site of the [[Soul Transfer]] she is attempting. She will be distracted by either Scott or Midnight, allowing Moe time to free [[Emilio]]. This will enrage Anna, and she will be overcome with the powers she is wielding, making her extremely dangerous. Moe will lead her to the main farmhouse so Emilio and Midnight can escape.

The conflict can end in one of two ways, depending on how the player handles the fight. The [[Ending 1 (The Farm)|first ending]] sees Moe weakening Anna enough to actually kill her. As the power is released from her body and Ridgewreath Farm itself, the house will collapse on top of Moe. Emilio and Midnight will come to free Moe from the rubble of the house, and in the epilogue, Moe will lament that she couldn't do more for Anna, but despite all that she has done, she never deserved to suffer for as long as she did.

The [[True Ending (The Farm)|second ending]] sees Moe leading Anna deeper into the house, into the secret area resembling her child's room. This option will be harder and requires a more defensive approach from the player, as Moe will need to protect herself across all 3 stories of the house. However, once Moe makes it to the room, Anna will become inconsolable with grief and break down at the foot of her child's bed.

Anna's appearance in future games will depend on how the first game is made. If it done in a way where Anna can survive, then that will be the canonical ending. Anna will be mentioned in passing during [[The Town||the second game]] and [[The Hunt (Project)|the third game]], regardless. If Anna can survive, she will appear in the third game to help Moe track down Priest.
