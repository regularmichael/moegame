Sal is the owner of [[The Last Line]], He is [[Moe]]'s boss, and truly, one of the very few people she would consider to be a friend. The hermit [[Thom]] is his twin brother.

 Sal is a warm and selfless man, and he takes great pride in the business he runs. He is very caring toward and protective of Moe, even referring to her as his "daughter" at one point. He doesn't fully understand her burden or mission ("I don't get none of this magic stuff"), but he is always willing to support her by letting her leave on sudden notice and return as she pleases. He always seems to have enough time to make care packages for her just before she leaves for a case.

*Gameplay*
Sal will play small supporting roles in the first two games ([[Ridgewreath Farm]] and [[The Town]]), usually as part of the segments that take place at The Last Line, or as part of Moe's memory made real in each game through psychometry or dreamscapes.

In the third game, Sal will appear frequently, as The Last Line will be a primary location in the game. He will be around to provide Moe more comfort and care packages. At some point, [[Priest(Narrative)|Priest]] will attack The Last Line and, despite Moe's extensive preparation, kill Sal in front of her. Sal's last lines to Moe will be, "This isn't your fault. I love you." 

While cradling Sal's body, Moe will discover that he was able to secure a piece of Priest's clothing, which will finally allow her to  [[Psychometry|thread]] Priest's location. In the approach to the final conflict, Priest will try to use Sal's image to distract and disorient Moe, which will be an obstacle players need to overcome.

In the epilogue, after Moe defeats Priest, she will take ownership of the restaurant and rename it "Sal's". Following in his footsteps, she will begin making care packages for the occult detective(s) she is currently mentoring.

***Q&A***
*How did Moe and Sal meet?*
At some point before the first game, Moe is introduced to Sal by his twin brother, Thom, after she is rescued from the woods where the failed [[Mandragora (Narrative)|Mandragora Ritual]] took place.

*Does Sal have any magical aptitude?*
No. Although Thom does, it was just never his interest. He just really loves to make food for people who need it. He knows how to use a gun though.

*How much does Sal know about Moe?*
She does her best to keep him in the dark as much as possible, as she doesn't want him endangered by her cases. That said, once the threat of Priest becomes imminent, she opens up to him more and does her best to provide myriad protections for him.

*Does Sal like Midnight?*
Loves her.
