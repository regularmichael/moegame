Animal Ken describes the natural ability for a person to create a sense of companionship with non-human animals.

A person with animal ken can do many things, including (but not limited to): quickly calm a scared or aggressive animal; create a sense of implicit trust; wordlessly communicate with animals; and, get animals to obey their commands.

This ability is considered mundane, as it can be learned naturally by a person. Generally, an animal whose favor is gained by a person will remember them and their relationship can be maintained with effort on the part of the person. Either party can initiate a meeting, but it is the natural gift of animal ken that allows person to make friends with the animal.

A spellcaster could certainly imitate animal ken using magical manipulation effects, but it may have adverse effects on the animal (disorientation, death, etc.) or the spellcaster (animal resorts to previously aggressive state and injures spellcaster).

*Game Elements*
Animal ken will be reflected in characters' interactions with animals that appear in the games. The player will not need to do anything to have it; it'll just be present in Moe's journey through the story, especially through her relationship with [[Midnight]]. 

Known animal ken in the narrative so far include:
- [[Moe]] forming a fast friendship with [[Midnight]] at [[The Farm (Project)]]. Without Midnight's assistance, Moe could very well have died at Ridgewreath.
- Moe's completion of the [[Creepy Crawlies]] side quests in each game.
- Various instances where Moe is able to make friends with an animal (a client's cat, a random frog hops up to her, etc.)
