Ringold is the cold, calculating leader of the [[Osenists]], a group of magic knowledge seekers who believe that magic should only be reserved for people who know how to use it. Ringold (and her follows) are very shrewd with regards to magic, and they believe they are the only ones who are worthy of keeping it in check.

Ringold herself has been the de facto leader of the Osenists since at least [[Moe]] joined them. She is the sole arbiter of Osenist rank, purpose, and operation. As a spellcaster, her power is considerable - as should be expected of someone whose organization relentlessly hordes all magic. However, she is perpetually confined to [[The Haze|the Haze]].

Ringold appears to have a disdain for the world. She finds the unpredictable nature of it to be a defect, and she believes the Osenists can be the one to address that defect. For Ringold, there is no such thing as "extreme" in the pursuit. She will gladly kill, alter, or steal if the ends justify the means. (Or, more specifically, she will have her Osenists followers do that on her behalf unless she is capable of doing so.)

Ringold rarely interacts with most Osenists directly, as she can only interact with others while they are inside of the Haze, and even then they require considerable power or knowledge to be of interest to her. For this reason, she often acts through chosen representatives. 

Ringold will first take interest in Moe during the [[Mandragora (Narrative)|ritual to raise the Mandragora]]. When Moe breaks Osenist dictum to upend the ritual herself and kill the miscarried creature, Ringold will notice that Osenist tactics of obfuscation were used during the scuffle, and will make note of Moe's escape into the world. While she would decree for the Osenists to hunt Moe down, she will be unable to directly track Moe for a number of reasons - Moe's familiarity with Ringold's tactics and the interference of the Mandragora in the Haze being the key factors. 

Despite her considerable reach in the Haze, Ringold is not omniscient nor omnipresent. She can only attend to matters of the Haze within her personal sphere and requires that her pool of knowledge grow so that she can increase her reach. For this reason, her abilities are truly limited to the knowledge she has available to her, either through the shared intelligence of her Osenist followers or from the expansive collection of magical artifacts they have collected over time. 

Ringold will be mentioned in the [[The Farm (Project)|first game]], around the time the Osenists descend onto [[Ridgewreath Farm]]. She will make her appearance in [[The Town (Project)|the second game]] as a deuteragonist who forms uneasy alliances with Moe and Zokaya to capture [[Priest]]. In this, she will act as a guide and hindrance for Moe during some of the more Haze/dream heavy sequences. During the final portion of the game, she will attempt to seize Moe and submit her to Osenist abandonment punishment, but the Mandragora will prevent this by banishing both itself and Ringold further into the Haze with a deafening scream. 

In the third game, [[Ringold]] will be a secondary antagonist, sending her Osenists to seek out both Moe and Priest. She will also be one of the forces in the Haze that will stalk Moe, as the reconciliation with the Mandragora leaves this game mechanic open to interpretation.

***Q&A***
*Why do the Osenists follow Ringold?*
In short, she knows that people want power, but she is only willing to give up a little bit of it. She will gladly grant Osenists the ability to use magic, but only if it extends her reach. Additionally, her conservative approach to magic and the "worthiness" of the Osenists attract a certain kind of people.

*Why would Moe choose to join an organization headed by someone like Ringold?*
In her younger days, Moe was an idealist, and could be easily swayed with the promise of being able to make a better world for people. As Moe became more familiar with the Osenist mission, she began to have doubts, but she was glad to help keep dangerous things away from people who could be hurt by them. Ringold's emissaries are very intentional in their messaging to keep people within the loop that increases Ringold's power.

*How similar are Priest and Ringold?*
Pretty similar. Priest relishes in anarchy and grows his power through the endless misery of others. Ringold is a firm believer in her own order and seeks to instill it so create a system of power that can't be challenged. Both are fervent in their unchecked thirst for power. Moe will be third order - not the balancing factor - that acts as a defense for the people who would be harmed by them.

*Is Ringold human?*
Maybe. As with Priest, we can leave it ambiguous.

*Is Ringold [[Barry]]?*
No. 

*Is Ringold Midnight?*
Unlikely. Midnight's a dog and can't really access the Haze, so she's not susceptible to Ringold's manipulation.
