The ability to witness events ("read") in the history of an object, spell, or living being through direct contact (i.e. with an ungloved hand). The psychometric reader cannot influence the history - they aren't time travelers, so they can't touch anything or bring it back with them. However, they can watch events unfold that they did not see themselves and gain a plethora of knowledge about the people, places, and things related to those events.

*Psychometric Readings*
To perform a reading, spellcasters must douse their bare hands with an ointment made from various components determined by the reader. Once the ointment is applied to their hands, they then firm grasp the *"psychometric focus"* - i.e. the subject of the psychometric reading - until a spiritual connection is formed. The spell then lasts as long as the reader maintains contact with the focus or until the focus has completely absorbed the ointment into their bodies, whichever happens first.

What the reader sees is determined by several things:
1. The characteristics of the *psychometric focus*. The particular histories that can be viewed and how they can be perceived through psychometry is different for each focus, but they follow the rules outlined in the following points.
2. The reader's magic power. Psychometry requires a great deal of effort to sustain on its own, let alone if the reader attempts to have clear insight into event. A more adept spellcaster with greater magical resources or casting stamina can make good use of the spell for a long period of time, although most would agree that efficiency is preferable to duration.
3. The reader's aptitude with psychometry itself. Psychometry is a fickle endeavor, as it can be perilous, tedious, or uncertain. For this reason, many novice spellcasters find psychometry to be overwhelming or unwieldy. Spellcasters who have honed their reading skills know what the spell wants from them, but that takes quite some time to learn.
4. The reader's familiarity with the history of the focus. An outside knowledge of events surrounding the focus can create more vivid psychometric readings. Consequently, a subject that has been read previously is easier to psychometrically analyze.

*Psychometric Focus*
The psychometric focus is the subject of the reading. This can be anything that makes contact with the skin of the reader. This most commonly applies to living beings, objects, or the environment, but it can also apply to spells or incorporeal bodies. Each of these foci have different effects on how a psychometric reading will proceed.

###### Objects 
Objects are the simplest focus for reading. A psychometric reading of an object or environment can tell the reader which events have happened near the focus. For example, a reader can touch a wrench, and in doing so may be able to see who held the wrench, what they did with it, and where they went while holding it. The vividness of an object or environment's reading depends on several factors:
1. The proximity of the focus to the event. A focus that is physically closer to an event with have a more vivid reading than a focus that is distant from the event. For example, if the reader takes the wrench and follows the reading to the machine it was used one, the reading will be as clear to a practiced reader as though they were witnessing the event on film. Taking the wrench further away from the event will muddy the reading, until eventually it reaches a point where it no vivid reading can happen at all.
   
   A skilled psychometric reader can use this clarity (or lack thereof) to bring themselves closer to a focus. This is called *threading*.
	   
2. The passage of time. A more recent event is easier to read than one in the distant past. Theoretically, the *entire* history of an object can be read, all the way back to the material that was used to make it being formed in the earth, and so on - however, the amount of effort it would require to do that is currently unfathomable.
   
3. The interaction of objects. Two or more objects that have interacted with each other can contribute to one reading and provide overlapping coverage of nearby events. 
   
   For example, a bag of marbles is knocked off a table during a scuffle, and the marbles scatter across the room. A reader who collect one marble closer to the bag and another one further away will have greater reading vividness because these objects share similar histories.
   
   Skilled readers use this technique frequently, although it does require more effort than reading just one object.
   
4. The significance of the focus to a living being. If the object is important to someone, it can provide a more vivid reading. A child may have many stuffed animals, but one is their *absolute favorite*. A reader will get more information out the child's favorite toy than any other toy they have.
   
   These readings can be quite informative. Readers can determine *why* this focus is important to someone, and how that person feels about the object. If a living being is thinking about the focus consistently, the reading will be consistently vivid. The child who can't wait to come home to that specific toy they love is providing more vividness to the reading. For this reason, objects of significant are ideal foci for *threading*.
   
   Of course, this significance must be actively maintained by the living being - if they are asleep, unaware, or otherwise not contributing to the significance of the foci, the reader will lose psychometric vividness.

###### Environments
Generally, environments follow the same rules as objects, including the elements of threading and the role of significance. In some cases, they tend to be less effective psychometric foci because it's difficult to manipulate an environment by hand, at least compared to an object. That said, there are several instances where choosing the environment as a focus can be advantageous.

When the object is no longer important to the reading, the psychometric focus can shift to the environment very easily. If a wrench is abandoned by the machine it was used to fix, but the wrench user still needs to be tracked, the reader can shift focus to the floor and follow footsteps.

Environments also provide many vantage points for a reader. In bedrooms and other small spaces, using each wall as a psychometric focus can provide a lot of detail to events that take place there.

Most importantly, areas where people spend a lot of time - bedrooms, bathrooms, places of work, and the like - can provide just as much information as object they use frequently. Thus, if an object is missing, the environment can be helpful!
   
###### Living Beings
Living beings are the richest, most complex, and most fickle of psychometric focuses.
