The man known as Priest is a sorcerer who derives his power from the misery of others. Few things are known about him, as he often chooses to reveal very little about himself - and even when he does, there is no way to know for sure if anything he says is true. It's not even known if he is human.

One thing that *is* known about him is that he feeds off the misery of the world and is actively empowered by the way despair affects magic. He often seeks out powerful but naive spellcasters and offers them false solutions to their woes. These spellcasters are usually the ones left behind by the more elite or secretive group of magicians, such as the [[Osenists]]. It should be noted that Priest won't just target spellcasters - anyone will do if it brings him amusement.

This creates wells of rancid magical energy for him to draw from based on the unresolved misery of the person he appeared to help, thus allowing him to leech off their power to build his own. His pursuit of this knows no bounds - he is happy to [[Thom|render someone incapable of speaking correctly]] just as much as he is [[Anna|sending a grieving mother on a fruitless quest to revive her dead child.]]

He not only subsists on this misery, but he actively enjoys perpetuating it. The joy he finds in multiplying the corruption of the world is immeasurable. He is known to sign off his astral-projection appearances with an echoing laugh, as if to trap those who witness him in a prison of his own glee.

He is an extremely gifted spellcaster, able to create massive illusions based in the experiences of other people. He is also able to make himself incorporeal at will, manipulation shadows and fire to expand or shrink, and magically enhance his own physical strength. 

Being aware of his deception does not automatically free people from his control - they have to consistently fight his influence. Many people choose to remain under his thrall even if it's brought to their attention that he is using them, usually under a misguided attempt to gain his favor so he'll share his power with them. (He'll always make them think he's doing just that - but it's not true.) 

Priest's long history of obstruction and chaos has earned him the ire of [[Ringold (Narrative)|Ringold]] and the Osenists. They seek a way to capture, study, and control him. Rather than leeching from their frustrations with him, he finds the Osenists pursuit troublesome more than anything - denying them the pleasure of having him just doesn't hit the same as his other endeavors. He also doesn't fear their power, with the possible exception of Ringold, though he holds more disdain for her than anything - though he does appreciate that they are indirectly feeding him.

He is aware of the occult detective [[Moe]]. Moe has already closed a few of his minor wells, including at [[The Smoking Mirror]] and (to some degree) Thom. However, her involvement in shutting down [[The Farm (Project)|Ridgewreath Farm]] will earn his attention. He will appear in psychometric vision in the first game, as well as making a direct address to Moe during her investigation.

Starting with the second game, he will assume the main antagonist role. He will be defeated at the end of the third game.

Q&A
*Is Priest a former Osenist?*
No.

*Do he and Moe have a history?*
No. Delegate all "antagonist who shares a background with the main character" impulses to [[Ringold (Narrative)]].

*Is Priest human?*
Unknown. Maybe. He could just be a fear elemental of some sort.

*Is Priest [[Barry]]?*
No.

*Why is Priest like this? Does he have a tragic backstory that makes him this way?*
No, and I don't intend on giving him any true backstory. We can lie about what we know about him, evidenced by characters having contradictory stories about who he is. But having a sad background is off the table.

For one, many of the other character's we'll be looking at - Anna, Zokaya, even Moe herself - will have "sad" backstories. We can't rely on this as a narrative crutch. We need to have a way to say: hey, sometimes, people just suck like that. You can have a bad time, but you don't have to bring others down with you.

Second, anything revealed about him will make him less terrifying. Based on what we already show him doing in the games, he's done some awful things to people, but that's only a snapshot of his life. It's what you *don't* know that informs you of the worst possible outcomes. Additionally, that's what makes him a good villain for Moe: Since she's a detective, what could be the greater than an adversary whose entire being is a mystery? 

Third, Priest's actions and viewpoints  should be more than enough to philosophically and morally contrast with Moe and Ringold. His presence alone should strike fear in the hearts of the players because people know that he stands for his own gain at all costs. We don't need to know *why* he feels that way, only that he's willing to do anything he can to reach that goal.

On that note, the reason that he is the primary villain of the series is that he will constantly test Moe's dictum: [[There is always another way]]. With other characters, Moe will have the opportunity to illustrate what the other way is or was - Anna can choose to redeem herself for the awful things she has done, without forgetting the people she has hurt. Simultaneously, Ringold will be so committed to her own mission that she chose no other way, and that's what brings her into conflict with Moe, Priest, and several other characters.

Priest, on the other hand, *is* the other way. He his route of desperation, paranoia, and success at all costs. He will aim to put people in terrible positions so that the "other way" isn't as good as Moe would like for it to be. He'll gladly do this Moe, often trying to force her to choose between different horrible outcomes, just to see if her resolve will break and open another well for him to draw from. It is the task of Moe (and the player) to play her own game, not his.

What she does with him after she has defeated him will be the final test of her character. Throughout the game, Moe will stridently favor of a restorative solution, and she'll have to brave tough situations, like reconciling with Cassie about Anna. These can be made understandable, and Moe can surely make the argument that Anna deserves to pay for her crimes in ways other than death - and that given the roles reversed, she would offer the same opportunities to other characters.

That raises the question: what do you do with someone who, like Priest, refuses restoration? If he could possibly survive and change his ways, then wouldn't killing him make Moe a hypocrite? How do you even know he'll make the effort to change if he survives? Based on what we've seen of him, he has no interest in changing, and keeping him alive will do nothing but bring more harm. In this case, shouldn't mercy be shown for the world, not for this one man?

Giving him *any* backstory - much less a tragic backstory - will make this answer far too obvious and cliche. It really holds Moe's (and the player's) hand to the end of the line when dealing with Priest. Moe isn't the Avatar and he's not Firelord Ozai. Although they are both spellcasters, Priest's power is fear, and Moe's power is an iron will. It's a matter of which will overcome when both are at their peaks. (How does this end? Not sure yet.)

In the end, it wouldn't really matter if Priest had a sad backstory. On the one hand, many people in this game (including Moe) will have rough backgrounds while being varying degrees of helpful or harmful. On the other, he'll still do horrible things whose weight and impact are far outsized compared to anything else in the game. 

*Is Priest Midnight?*
No.
