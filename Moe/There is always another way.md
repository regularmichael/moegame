"There is always another way" is a mantra Moe will use to guide herself and the player toward action.

For Moe, this means, 'You can always choose kindness.' She know that this statement goes both ways, and she's willing to go to extreme lengths to reach a restorative end if she believes its possible. This can be shown one of the endings for [[The Farm (Project)]], where the final conflict can be resolved by, instead of more senseless death, Moe can lead [[Ana]] on a path to recognize the harm she has done.

However, when it comes to certain instances (i.e. [[Priest(Narrative)|Priest]], [[Ringold (Narrative)|Ringold]]), "there is always another way" may be Moe pointing out that they chose *not* to take the other way, and their downfall at her hands is outcome is their own result.

For the player, this can be a reminder from Moe that they have some choices they *can* make. For example, in the [[Creepy Crawlies]] side quest, you could certainly use some living creatures to achieve some spells. Alternatively, you can find another outcome that doesn't involve sacrificing a life for the sake of convenience.
