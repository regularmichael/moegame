Midnight is a dog that [[Moe]] encounters at [[Ridgewreath Farm]]. Seen in passing a few times as she hides around the farm, Midnight will incidentally save Moe after she is almost lost in [[the Haze]] following her defeat of the [[Barn Abomination]]. 

After a final thrash from the beast splits open Moe's protective gloves, Midnight will come up and start licking her hand, causing her [[Psychometry|psychometric]] powers to refocus through Midnight's experiences. It is from this accidental reading that Moe will learn about Anna and her [[Soul Transfer]] ritual. From this reading and their shared trust of each other, Moe and Midnight will develop an almost telepathic connection akin to a perpetual threading, but without the risk that comes with entering the Haze.

For the rest of the [[The Farm (Project)]], Midnight will be a constant companion and source of information. She will aid the injured Moe as she carries a ladder from the barn to the main house, acting a sentry to warn her of approaching [[Lost Souls|enemies]]. As Moe begins to raise the ladder, she'll be attacked by [[Scoth]]. Midnight will bite the man and lure him away from the House so Moe can continue her investigation.

After Moe leaves the main house again, Midnight will rejoin her for the remainder of the game. She will assist in finding [[Arturo]] in the [[Grain Silo]], and warn Moe of Scoth's next appearance there. If this meeting with Scoth turns into a fight, Midnight will assist her by occasionally biting him, granting her enough time to focus her magic on him.

If Scoth is defeated there, Midnight can be read to find the information needed on [[Anna's Baby]].

As Moe finds what she needs to reach [[Emilio]], bypass the invading [[Osenists]], and approach [[Anna|Anna's ritual site]], Midnight will continue to run distraction during combat or stealth scenarios. In the confrontation with Anna at the climax of the game, Midnight will grab Anna's spell focus and run off with it. This gives Moe time to free Emilio and help him recover before sending him to her truck.

Midnight will catch a magic blast from Anna, but Moe will stop the enraged sorceress before she can kill the dog. She'll tell Midnight to run to her truck while she deals with Anna. [[Ending 1 (The Farm)|In one ending]], Moe's fight with Anna will cause the house to collapse, and Moe will come to to find Emilio is removing the rubble from on top her while Midnight licks her face. This will show that their cycle of helping each other out is perpetual. [[True Ending (The Farm)|In the second ending]], Moe will return to her truck to find that Midnight and Emilio are anxiously waiting for her.

It is important to note that in the first game, Midnight will not have a name. Moe will affectionately call her "girl", "lady", and the like. It is between the first and second game where Midnight will acquire her name, as Moe starts to realize that they can share a perspective, and she lets the dog "name" herself.

Throughout the rest of the games, Midnight will be Moe's constant investigative and combat companion. There will be times when Moe will have to dismiss Midnight for her own safety, but Midnight will always find her way back. 

*Q&A*
*Is Midnight a magical creature?*
No. Midnight's just a dog that found herself in the same bad situation as Moe.

*Is Midnight an agent of [[Priest]] or [[Ringold (Narrative)|Ringold]]?*
No. Midnight is a free agent that found herself aligning with Moe out of mutual trust.

*In game, can Midnight be hurt?*
I don't see why it can't happen, but we shouldn't force players to manage her health or stamina or anything. She should just be part of the scenery as well, and if she goes *down*, it's just a hiding/limping animation until Moe can help her.

*How will Midnight help with investigation?*
Her sense of smell is better than Moe's, and it's more reliable (and less dangerous) than psychometry, so Moe will probably use that as her first point of tracking. Midnight can also put people at ease if they like dogs. They'll also be able to share information with each other through their special threading bond.

*How will Midnight help with combat?*
Midnight can obviously be a point of distraction, but only for one enemy. She could also bite an enemy that is focused on Moe, allowing her to get some space. Finally, if they have to ambush, an enemy, Midnight can make a surprise attack where Moe may not be able to.

*Will Midnight die in any of the games?*
Hard no. Why are you asking that? >=(
