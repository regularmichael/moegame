A side quest in each game where Moe can find and rescue small critters from unfortunate situations. These creatures can include:
* Rats
* Mice
* Spiders
* Snakes
* Centipedes
* Scorpions

The idea here is to build into the game the idea that Moe is looking out for the *whole* range of misbegotten creatures. Once she is able to collect them, they'll be safe until she is prompted to release them, usually as she is transitioning from one area to another.

These creatures could, in some instances, be used as spell components. However, this would surely end their lives and send their spirits into a state of purgatory. Moe recognizes that this is necessary in some cases, but [[There is always another way]].
