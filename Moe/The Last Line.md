The Last Line is the name of the restaurant owned by [[Sal]]. [[Moe]] works here, and this is also where she tends to meet her clients. The food served here, as well as the general aesthetic of the place, is typical American style. Moe is a line cook who typically works out of sight from the general seating area. 

*Gameplay*
The first game ([[Ridgewreath Farm]]) will begin with [[Cassie]] coming to meet Moe here. Sal will recognize that Moe needs to leave and he will give her a care package.

The second game ([[The Town]]) will feature The Last Line as part of Moe's initial dream sequence, and it will be part of her dreamscapes throughout the game. She will also leave a shift at The Last Line and give Sal a customary hug goodbye.

The third game (The Hunt for Priest) will feature The Last Line quite a few times, including transitionary spots where Moe and Sal will talk. An actual gameplay segment in The Last Line. Moe will need to defend the restaurant from an ambush by [[Priest(Gameplay)|Priest]]. During this segment, Sal will be killed just outside of The Last Line.

In the epilogue of the series, Moe takes ownership of The Last Line and renames it "Sal's."

***Q&A***
*How did Moe get hired?*
She met [[Sal]] through [[Thom]]. He hired her, and she has stayed a loyal employee for many years.

*Where is The Last Line, geographically?*
I imagine it to be part of a "pit stop"-type area on a long stretch of road in a plains or desert-style environment. The Last Line as a restaurant that shares a parking lot with a large gas station (currently unnamed). This gas station has showers, which Moe uses frequently. The employees know her, but they're uncertain if they like her.

*Does Moe like her job?*
It's a livin'. Sal has done a lot for her, and she gets along fine with the rest of the employees. It meets her needs, even giving her and [[Midnight]] food, so she doesn't see the point in changing something that's working just fine.

*How's the food?*
Pretty good! Everyone from Cassie to Priest will say that.

*Why does she choose to meet people at The Last Line?*
Several reasons. The first is convenience - she's always in the area. The second is that it's so isolated that she can neutralize any threat without getting many people involved, or she can also keep a smaller area protected at all times. The third, she can feed her clients, just in case they haven't eaten yet. The fourth - despite being a pitstop area on a long stretch of rode - the area and the restaurant itself are so typical they border on nondescript. This makes it easier to obscure from divination, including psychometry.

*Why is it called The Last Line?*
Vaati will tell you it's because Moe, as the last line of defense for the downtrodden, makes this her base of operations. Sal (and I) will tell you that it's because it's the last line you cross before you get to where you're going.
