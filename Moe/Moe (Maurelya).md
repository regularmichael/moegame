Maurelya ("Moe"), by day, is a line cook at a roadside diner, working for her friend Sal. Her true job is a detective that investigates cases dealing with the strange, the magical, and the occult.

Moe was once a member of the Osenists, an enclave of secret magicians devoted to the preservation of magical knowledge. They believed that magic, if not perfectly executed, was not worthy of execution at all. She worked as a Prospectus Archivist, where she helped managed
the books, instruments, and resources of the Osenists.

Moe was the sole interloper of the plan to raise the Mandragora. The ritual would not be entirely successful regardless of her intervention, but she was able to subdue and destroy the imperfect creature before it could cause untold destruction. Knowing this would brand her a traitor of the Osenists, she fled. 

Now deeply aware of the harm she has been complicit to, she has devoted herself to a life of helping others.
